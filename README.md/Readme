# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
Course 3 in Data Science Specialization

##Project Description The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.


Submission requirements:
A tidy data set as described below.
A link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis. 
A code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. 
A README.md in the repo with scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example this article . Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

##Repo Overview This project contains full description in the CodeBook file. CodeBook.md describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data. The output file of the sctipt is called FinalData.txt, and uploaded in the course project's data folder.
##Data Description You can find additional information about the variables, data and transformations in the CodeBook.MD file.
